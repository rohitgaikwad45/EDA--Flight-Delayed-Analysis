# EDA--Flight-Delayed-Analysis


## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of flight delay data to identify key factors contributing to delays. Using Python, the project explores the dataset through univariate and bivariate analysis, aiming to uncover patterns and correlations that impact departure and arrival times.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, feature selection, and data cleaning.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization of data distributions and relationships between variables using `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.
- **Visualization**: Detailed histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to present insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting and graphical representation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
